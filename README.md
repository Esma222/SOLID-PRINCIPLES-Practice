SOLID PRINCIPLES

S ➡ Single Responsibility
Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.

O ➡ Open Closed
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

L ➡ Liskov Substitution
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

I ➡ Interface Segregation
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can’t do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

D ➡ Dependency Inversion
Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
